## Hey there, I'm Meri !  ｡* . ﾟ☆
I am a Front-End Developer based in Brazil, focused on transforming design visions into functional, accessible, and high-performance interfaces.

I believe that technology should bring design to life in a fluid way, prioritizing usability on both mobile devices and the web.

I am constantly learning, exploring modern tools to deliver products that combine aesthetics and excellent technical execution.

Currently, I'm working on <a href="https://github.com/meriadriao/trove-clock">Trove</a>, a Pomodoro tracker app.
