## Hey there, I'm Meri !  ｡* . ﾟ☆
I am a Front-End Developer based in Brazil, focused on transforming design visions into functional, accessible, and high-performance interfaces.

I believe that technology should bring design to life in a fluid way, prioritizing usability on both mobile devices and the web.

I am constantly learning, exploring modern tools to deliver products that combine aesthetics and excellent technical execution.

Currently, I'm working on [Trove](https://github.com/meriadriao/trove-clock), a Pomodoro tracker app, and on [K+](https://github.com/meriadriao/kmais-calendar), a calendar for runners.
